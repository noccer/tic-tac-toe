# Niall's Tic-Tac-Toe

The key features I wanted in my game were:

- A game that is simple to look at and is mobile responsive.
- An option to vary the grid size from a 3x3 grid to a 5x5 grid.
- For larger grids, an option to choose how many tiles in a row win the game.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 - Many transition effects!
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Google Fonts
- ShakyCSS - To make already clicked buttons shake!

## Approach Taken

I opted to go for the Magic numbers solution. This was highly challenging because depending

## Unsolved Problems

- No reset button at the end of the game
- When a round is complete, if the winning player clicks the board again, they win another round! This was actually very useful for simulating full game runs.
- The bottom buttons need more logic added so that they display at the correct times.
- Bottom buttons need further conditional styling so that their text does not display when a round is won.

## Features Left Out

I would have liked to roll out more features into the frontend of the game. The backend engine has been programmed to take some of the following user inputs:

- Player Name
- Player Letter (X or O or anything else)
- Number of Games to win match

I would have liked to have programmed in the following logic:

- After round 1, 1st player to play is the loser from the last round.
- When a player wins, the tiles that won their game are highlighted.
